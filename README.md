# 👋 Hi there, I'm Prerona Ghosh

🎯 Embedded Software Engineer | Real-Time Systems | C | C++ | Python | Multimedia Frameworks

I'm an engineer with over 4 years of experience building real-time, high-performance embedded applications in the automotive and multimedia space. My work spans across C++ development, inter-process communication, multimedia pipelines, and performance tuning on embedded platforms.

🛠️ I enjoy solving deep technical problems, working on systems close to the hardware, and building things that matter.

🧘‍♀️ When I’m not working, you’ll find me exploring new places, sipping coffee while reading, swimming late at night, or dreaming up my next side project.
